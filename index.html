					<h2 >Components/Parts</h2>
					<p>The quality of the components and parts on a bike are directly related to the quality of the bike they are on. Therefore, espescially when looking at newer bikes where cheap and expensive frames are harder to tell apart, being able to identify the quality of a bike's parts is important in assessing the value of a bike </p>

                                <p>The easiest way to tell good wheels/rims apart from bed ones is by looking at their material. A cheap bike will use chrome plated steel, whereas a nice bike will use an alloyed material. The alloyed material is usually duller and softer looking than the chrome plated material. Another important factor is the shape of the rim. An expensive bike will have more of a rounded shape compared to the sharp edged rims put on cheaper bikes.</p>

                                <p>As with the wheels, the first thing you should look at is the material. A nice bike will always use an alloy outfit.</p>

                    <h2>Frame</h2>
                    <p>Along with simply identifying the bike's brand, a bike frame can indicate the value in a number of ways.</p>

                            <h4><a name="Frame">Frame</a></h4>
                            <p>The most important thing to look for on the frame apart from the label is the tube material. A high quality bike will usually have a sticker on it indicating the manufacturer and/or material of the bike frame. If the sticker reads Reynold's or Columbus, chances are it is a chromium and/or molybdenum alloy which is what most valuable road bikes were made of.</p>

                            <p>A nice (steel) bike will always have lugs. The rule for identifying nice lugs is that the expensive ones will be very ornate. This is very telling to the over-all value of the violin as ornate lugs can only be handcut and are therefore very costly.</p>
